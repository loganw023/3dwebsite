        <h3> My college plans</h3>
        <p>
          Personally, I have many college plans, as a current junior in high school!
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to apply for engineering, but still don't know which specific major to choose. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I plan on applying to:
        </p>
        <p>
          UCLA
        </p>
        <p>
          Stanford
        </p>
        <p>
          UCSD
        </p>
        <p>
          Purdue
        </p>
        <p>
          UIUC
        </p>
        <p>
          Georgia Tech
        </p>
        <p>
          And many more!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately though, I do not want to pay too much for college!!
